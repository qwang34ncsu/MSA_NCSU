############ Game Rule ###############

# Initialize the board to be empty.
# X starts, and chooses a position to place their marker.
# O positions their marker in any empty position.
# After each marker is placed, a check is made to see whether either player has won.
# Placement alternates until a player wins or the board is full, at which point the game is called for a tie.
