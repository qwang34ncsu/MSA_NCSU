## Game Rule

### 1. Initialize the board to be empty.
### 2. X starts, and chooses a position to place their marker.
### 3. O positions their marker in any empty position.
### 4. After each marker is placed, a check is made to see whether either player has won.
### 5. Placement alternates until a player wins or the board is full, at which point the game is called for a tie.
